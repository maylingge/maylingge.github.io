# Unicode & Encoding 
    a Unicode string is a sequence of code points, which are numbers from 0 to 0x10ffff. 
    This sequence needs to be represented as a set of bytes (meaning, values from 0â€“255) in memory. 
    The rules for translating a Unicode string into a sequence of bytes are called an encoding.
