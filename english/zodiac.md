# What's your sign?
In western **astrology**, it's a **constellation** determined by when your birthday falls in the calender.
But according to the Chinese **zodiac**, or sheng xiao.
It's your shu xiang, meaning the animal assigned to your **birth year**.

And of the many myths explaining these animal signs and their arrangement. The most **enduring** one is that of the great race.
As the story goes, Yu Di, or **Jade emperor**, ruler of the heavens, wanted to devise a way to measure the time. so he organized a race

The first twelve animals to make it across the river, will earn a spot on the **zodiac calender** in the order they arrive.
The rat rose with the sun to get an early start.
On the way to the river, he met the horse, the tiger and the ox. Because the rat was small and couldnt swim very well. He asked the big animal for help. while the tiger and horse refused, the kind-hearted ox agreed to carry the rat across.
Yet, just as they were about to reach the other side, the rat jumped off the ox's head and **secured** the first place.

The ox came in the second with the powerful tiger right behind him.

The rabbit too small to battle the current, **nimbly** **hopped** across stones and logs to come in forth. 
Next came the dragon, who could have **flown directly across** but stopped to help some creatures she had encountered on the way.

After here came the horse **galloping** across the river, but just as she got across, the sname **slithered by**.
The startled horse reared back, letting the snake **sneak** into sixth place.
The jade emperor looked out at the river and spotted the sheep, the monkey and the rooster **all atop a raft**, working together to push it through the weeds. when they made it across.

The trio agreed to give the eighth place to the sheep who has been the most comforting and harmonious of them. followed by the monkey and rooster. 

Next came the dog **scrambling onto** the shore. He was a great swimmer. But **frolicked** in the water for so long , he only managed to come in eleventh. THe final spot was detained by the pig. who got hungry and started to eat and nap before finally **waddling** the finish line.

As so, each year as associated with one of the animals in this order with a cycle starting over every 60 years.
why 60 years not 12?
Well, the traditional chinese calender is made up of two overlapping systems. The animals of the zodiac is associated with what called the twelve earthly branches, or shierdizhi.
Another system, the Ten heavenly stems or tiangan, is linked with five classical elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Each element is assigned Yin or Yang, creating a ten year cycle. When the twelve animals of the earthly branches matched with the five elements cross the Ying or Yang of the heavenly stems. It creates 60 years of different combinations. Known as **sexagenary cycle** or gan zhi. 
So someone born in 1980 would have the sign of yang metal monkey. While someone born in 2007 would be yin fire pig.

In fact, you can an inner animal based on your birth month. A true animal based on your birth date. And a secret animal based on your birth hour. It was the great race that supposingly determined which animals were **enshrined** in the CHinese zodiac.

But as the system spread through Asia, other cultures made changes to reflect their communities.
So if your consult the Vietanmee zodiac, you may dicover you are a cat not a rabbit. And if you are in TaiLand, a mythical snake called a Nage replaces the dragon.
So whether or not you place stock in what the zodiac says about you as an individual. It certainly reveals much about the culture it comes from.
