# The Great wall

A 13,000 mile dragon of earth and stone **winds** its way through the countryside of china with a history almost as long and serpentine as the structure.

The Great wall began as multiple walls of rammed earth built by individual **feudal states** during the Chunqiu period to protect against **nomadic** raiders north of China and each other. 

When Emperor Qin Shi Huang unified the states in 221 BCE, the Tibetan Plateau and Pacific Ocean became natural barriers, but the mountains in the north remains vulnerable to Mongol, Turkish and Xiongnu invasions. To defend against them, the Emperor expanded the small walls built by his predecessors, connecting some and **fortifying** others. As the structures grow from Lintao in the west to Liaodong in the east, they collectively became known as the long wall. To accomplish this task, the Emperor **enlisted** soldiers and **commoners** not always voluntarily. Of the **hundreds of thousands of** builders recorded during the Qin Dynasty, many were forcibly conscripted **peasants** and others were criminals **serving out sentences**. 

Under the Han Dynasty, the wall grew longer **still** reaching 3700 miles and **spanning** from DunHuang to the Bohai sea. Forced labor continued under the Han Emperor Han-Wu-Di and the walls reputation grew into a **notorious** place of suffering. Poems and Legends of the time told of laborers buried in nearby mass graves or even within the wall itself. And while no human remains have been found inside, grave pits do indicate that many workers died from accidents, hunger and exhausion. 

The wall was **formidable** but not **invincible**. Both Genghis and his son Khublai Khan managed to **surmount** the wall during the Mongol invasion of the 13th Century. 

After the Ming Dynasty gained control in 1368, they began to refortify and further consolidate the wall using bricks and stones from local **kilns**. Averaging 23 feet high and 21 feet wide, the walls 5500 miles were punctuated by watchedtowers. When raiders were sighted, fire and smoke signals traveled between towers until reinforcement arrives. Small openings along the wall let **archers** fire on invaders while larger ones were used to drop stones and more. But even this new and improved wall was not enough. 

In 1644, northern ManChu **clans** overthrew the Ming to establish Qing Dynasty **incorperating** Mongolia as well. Thus, for the second time, China was ruled by the very people the wall had tried to keep out. With the empire's border now extending beyond the great wall, the **fortifications** lost their purpose. And without regular reinforcement, the wall fell into disrepair, rammed earth **eroded** while bricks and stones were **plundered** for building materials. 

But its job wasnt finished. During world war II, China used sections for defense Japanese invasion and some parts are still rumored to be used for military training. But the wall's main purpose today is cultural. As one of the largest man-made structures on Earth, it was granted UNESCO World heritage status in 1987. Originally built to keep people out of China, the Great Wall now welcomes millions of visitors each year. In fact, the **influx** of tourists has caused the wall to **deteriorate**, leading the Chinese goverment to launch preservation initiatives. 

It's also ofen acclaimed as the only visible man-made structure from the space. Unforturnately, that's not at all true. In low Earth **orbit**, all structures like bridges, highways and airports are visible, and the Great Wall is only barely **discernible**. From the moon, it doesnt stand a chance. But regardless, it's the Earth we should be studying it from because new sections are still discovered every few years, branching off from the main body and expanding this remarkable monument to human achievement.

# Time management
When people find out I write about time management, they assume two things. One is that I am always on time. And I am not. I four small children. And I would like to blame them for my occasional **tardiness**. But sometimes, it's just not their fault. I was once later for my own speech on time management. We all have to take this moment together and **savor** that irony. The second is I have a lot of tips and tricks for saving bits of time here and there. Sometimes, I hear from magzines that how to help their readers to find an extra hour a day. And the idea is we will shave my time in everyday activies and add it up and we will have time for the good stuff. I question the entire premise of the entire piece. I always interesting .  You know another way to find 30 minutes to exercise. Dont watch two hours TV a day. Anyway, the idea is we will save bits of time here and there. we will finally get to everything we want to do. 

We dont build the life we want by saving time. We build the life we want and time saved itself.

could you find seven hours to mentor seven worthy people. Cant you see how busy I am.

Time is highly elastic. We cannot make more time. Time will stretch to accommodate where we put it into. The key to time management is to treat our priorities as equivalent as the broken waterheater.
