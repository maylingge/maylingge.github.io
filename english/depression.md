depression is the leading cause of disability in the world.

In united states, close to 10% of adults struggle with depression. But because it is a mental illness.

it could be a lot harder to understand then, say 
one major source of confusion is the difference between having depression and just feel depression.
almost everyone feels down from time to time, getting a bad grade, losing a job, having an argument. even a rainy day can bring on feelings of sadness.
sometime, there is no trigger at all. it just pops up out of the blue. THen circumstance changes, and those feelings disappear.

clinical depression is different. it's a medical disorder. it wont go aways just because you want to.
it lingers for at least two consecutive weeks. and significantly interferes with one's ability to work, play or love.

Depression can have a lot of different symptoms:
a low mood, lost interesting in things you normally enjoy, changes in appetie. guilty,  sleeping either too much or too little poor concentration, restless or slowness.
loss of energy, or recurrent thoughts of sucide.
If you have at leat five of these symptoms, acoording to guidelines,  you qualify for a diagnosis of depression.
It's not just behavior sym.

Depression has pythical there are changes could be seen with naked eye and X-ray vision.

still dont have a complete picture of what causes depression.

a complex interaction between genes and environment.
it's hard to know who might look fine but is actually struggling.


TO someone with depression, this first step.
if they feel guilty and ashamed, point out the depression is just a medical.


avoid comparing with time you feel down.
even just talking about depression openly, reduce their suicide risk.
Open conversation, 
More patient seek treatment,
the better the treatment will get.
